All work done by myself, Amitha Soundararajan, Maya McFadden, Shay McDowell, and Julia Foy.

Developed a matching algorithm to streamline the Panhellenic Sorority Recruitment Process. Worked on the back-end team to design and implement a Python algorithm that matches potential new members to a group of members based on specific weighted factors, such as similarity of hometown or major.
