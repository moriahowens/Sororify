## Pseudocode for how PNMs will be matched to a bump group


for i=100 -> i=0:
	for each Pnm:
		for each percent in list:
			if percent == 1:
				find index aka bump group
				append PNM to bump group list (another dictionary)
				remove PNM from available list
				update the # of PNMs that can still be assigned to that bump group (if len(PNM_assignments_list) < 3)


--- Output of the algorithm:

Bump Group 1:
	PNM Hannah Example: Matched 94%
	PNM Jane Doe: Matched 87%
	PNM Julia Sample: Matched 92%
